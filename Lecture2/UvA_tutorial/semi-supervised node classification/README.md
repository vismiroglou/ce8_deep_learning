Node-level tasks have the goal to classify nodes in a graph. Usually, we have given a single, large graph with >1000 nodes of which a certain amount of nodes are labeled. We learn to classify those labeled examples during training and try to generalize to the unlabeled nodes.

A popular example that we will use in this tutorial is the Cora dataset, a citation network among papers. The Cora consists of 2708 scientific publications with links between each other representing the citation of one paper by another. The task is to classify each publication into one of seven classes. Each publication is represented by a bag-of-words vector. This means that we have a vector of 1433 elements for each publication, where a 1 at feature i indicates that the i-th word of a pre-defined dictionary is in the article. Binary bag-of-words representations are commonly used when we need very simple encodings, and already have an intuition of what words to expect in a network. There exist much better approaches, but we will leave this to the NLP courses to discuss.
