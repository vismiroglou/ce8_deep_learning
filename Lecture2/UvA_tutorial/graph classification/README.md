We will have a closer look at how to apply GNNs to the task of graph classification. The goal is to classify an entire graph instead of single nodes or edges. Therefore, we are also given a dataset of multiple graphs that we need to classify based on some structural graph properties. The most common task for graph classification is molecular property prediction, in which molecules are represented as graphs. Each atom is linked to a node, and edges in the graph are the bonds between atoms.

The dataset we will use below is called the MUTAG dataset. It is a common small benchmark for graph classification algorithms, and contain 188 graphs with 18 nodes and 20 edges on average for each graph. The graph nodes have 7 different labels/atom types, and the binary graph labels represent "their mutagenic effect on a specific gram negative bacterium" (the specific meaning of the labels are not too important here). The dataset is part of a large collection of different graph classification datasets, known as the TUDatasets, which is directly accessible via torch_geometric.datasets. TUDataset (documentation) in PyTorch Geometric.
